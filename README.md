# BatteryTimes
This includes two Python programs (chargeTime.py and depleteTime.py) used to time the charging and depleting process for any battery. They start by asking the user for the capacity of their battery and then the initial percentage. When the user is ready they can enter done followed by the final percentage. All useful information including the average current and total estimated time from 0% to 100% or 100% to 0% as well as an estimate from 0% to 70% or 70% to 0% depending on the script. 0% to x% for chargeTime.py and x% to 0% for depleteTime.py. HumanTime.py is a script I wrote and a necessary dependency of the two main programs. It is responsible for providing a human readable time with seconds, minutes, hours, days, and years if necessary. It must be put in the same directory as the other files in order for import statements to work. Enjoy seeing how quickly your devices gain and spend chemical potential energy!
